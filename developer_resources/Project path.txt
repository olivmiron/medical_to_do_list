I. Scope:
 - to make the task of managing patients simpler
     - a way of storing relevant information of the patient (notes written inside the app, photos of the patient etc.)
     - a place to photograph and store the patient's file for easier online access

 - to have a lit of tasks to be done so nothing is forgot
     - task can be noted in the order of importance
     - tasks can have due dates
    
     - we can store information alongside any task (written notes, photos, small videos)

    - simply frictionless (verifies log in automatically, when creating something, all the options have defaults, so you can easily create it if, f.e., you wan a simple to do entry)
    - Panoramic/all-encompassing viewing (all encompasing view depending obn what you open; for example, if you open a patient to see it's files/photos, you also see the to do list associated with that patient)

    - Memory: If you were doing anythnig and closed the app, it stores its view and what you were doing and when you re-open it, it re-opens that view and completes your to do, for example    
    - A lot of settings;
